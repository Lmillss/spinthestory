                <h3 class="column-headline">About "Blurred Realities"</h3>
                <p>
                    We immerse ourselves in fairy tales and science fiction, fully aware that some elements
                    are pure fantasy. Yet, we bristle when we discover that a viral video was fabricated or
                    that a striking photograph was generated by AI. Why do we so easily accept some
                    fabrications while questioning others?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Blurred Realities invites you to examine the dilemmas tied to disinformation and
                    misinformation, artificial intelligence, and shifting perceptions of truth. This exhibition is
                    not just about deception; it is about the ways our perceptions are shaped, guided, and
                    sometimes manipulated. How do we determine what is real, what is fabricated, and
                    what is designed to deceive?
                </p>
                <p>
                    As technology increasingly influences our perspectives, it also amplifies biases,
                    reshapes conversations, and reinforces divisions. In an era where trust is fragile, we
                    must reconsider not just what we see, but how we see and understand. This exhibition
                    challenges you to think critically, to question the narratives you accept, and to recognize
                    the forces that shape your understanding of the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we mark the 250th anniversary of American democracy, these questions take on
                    even greater urgency. A nation built on the ideals of informed debate and collective
                    decision-making must grapple with how truth is constructed, contested, and controlled.
                    Blurred Realities invites us to reflect on how we navigate this evolving
                    landscape—individually and as a society—in pursuit of a more informed future.
                    The exhibition is made possible through the generous support of the Michigan State University
                    Federal Credit Union (MSUFCU).

                <h3 class="column-headline">The Power of Bias in Shaping Reality</h3>
                
                <p>
                Cognitive and social biases shape not only what we believe, but how we interpret
                reality. We are naturally inclined to seek out and trust information that aligns with our
                existing values and worldviews, a tendency known as confirmation bias. This
                phenomenon can lead us to ignore, dismiss, or distrust new information that challenges
                our beliefs, reinforcing our existing perspectives and influencing our capacity for
                meaningful dialogue with others.
                </p>
                <p>
                Technologies like social media and AI often amplify these biases. Algorithms
                personalize content based on past behavior, surrounding us with ideas and opinions we
                are more likely to agree with. Marketers, politicians, and influencers further leverage
                these tendencies, crafting emotionally charged messages designed to resonate with
                existing beliefs and keep us engaged. This ultimately creates filter bubbles in our online
                engagement, where we rarely encounter opposing viewpoints, and our sense of truth
                becomes increasingly shaped by systems designed to maximize attention, not
                accuracy.
                </p>
                <p>
                AI is also not exempt from bias. Because these models are trained with human-
                generated data, they often reproduce the stereotypes and inequalities already present
                in society. When left unchecked, these tools can reinforce systemic inequities, distort
                public discourse, and influence our perceptions of the world under the guise of
                objectivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                As AI becomes more central to how we access information, it’s essential to question:
                who and what shapes the results—and who stands to benefit?
                </p>

                <h3 class="column-headline">Truth and Manipulation in a Digital Age</h3>
                <p>
                Social media transformed how we access information, offering new ways to learn,
                connect, and explore the world. Yet, these platforms can just as easily be used to distort
                the truth. With the growing sophistication of AI, it can be even more difficult to
                distinguish a true story from what has been embellished or entirely fabricated.
                Deepfakes, AI-generated images, and manipulated narratives can spread rapidly, often
                without clear markers to indicate they are false.
                </p>
                <p>
                Although some social media platforms introduced fact-checking labels or community
                notes to slow the spread of misinformation, these efforts are fairly limited. Outside of our
                own responsibility to fact check the information we encounter on social media, there are
                few regulations preventing people from intentionally posting and spreading false
                content.
                </p>
                <p>
                Sometimes, this lack of focus on the truth is intentionally leveraged by individuals or
                organizations to spark outrage and create confusion. These posts are then amplified by
                recommendation algorithms and marketing that prioritizes engagement (likes, shares,
                clicks), over accuracy. The more a post resonates emotionally or goes viral, the more
                it’s promoted. This selective exposure reinforces what we already believe, making it
                even harder to see diverse perspectives or evaluate information critically.

                <h3 class="column-headline">Reimagined Narratives</h3>
                <p>
                We constantly engage with fabrications—reading stories, playing video games, or
                watching movies all require us to set aside what is real and temporarily accept a new
                reality. These fictions can help us build empathy for perspectives and stories that are
                not our own, ponder the future, and imagine the "what-if's" of the past. Even though we
                know these experiences to be fictional, they can impact our lives in real ways and are
                still grounded in the visions of the artists who created the works.
                </p>
                <p>
                What happens when we begin to use AI to create these fictions? From reimagining
                ancestral legacies to reminiscing about childhood memories, people are increasingly
                using AI for the development of stories, memories, and reimagined worlds. As you'll see
                throughout the exhibition, AI can be biased and flawed, so even intentionally using it to
                generate fictional outputs creates a unique product - one that's been first conceptualized
                by a person and then filtered through the lens of the AI model.
                </p>
                <p>
                With the right prompts, these technologies can be used to question, reinterpret, and
                reconfigure the stories we tell about ourselves, challenging dominant narratives,
                amplifying voices, and speculating on alternate histories or futures. They may also
                create content that feels unsettling, like a memory that is barely out of reach. Pieces like
                this offer us the opportunity to contemplate the complex nature of creativity, truth,
                technology, and what it means to engage in realities outside of our own.
